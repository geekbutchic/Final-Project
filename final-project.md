# Grocery List 

### Description
Often times I found myself having to make a grocery list since I like to watch my caloric intake and prefer home cooked meals.  Often times I end up using the notes app on my iPhone which is fine.  But an application would be better.  It would have some features I'm often missing.

## Header - First Container
* Grocery List 

## Navigation - Second Container
* Date
* Store 
* Budget

## Main Application - Third Container 
* ## First Sub - Container

    * ### `Add To List` 
    * User will be able to add items to the list up to 20.
    * The user input will determine what goes in list.
    * When the user clicks on the list it is removed and appears on the removed list, with a strike through.

* ## Second Sub Container

    * ### `Remove from list `
    * They can also un-click the item to return it to the `ADD TO LIST`

* ## Third Sub Container

    * ### `Remaining Items`
    * Not sure how to do this but would like to have items that were not found to be placed in remaining container.


### Stretch Goal 
* The remaining items will be moved into final container, beginning a new list.
